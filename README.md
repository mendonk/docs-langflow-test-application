## Purpose

Create a web application that sends data to Langflow and returns a useful result.
Export a flow from the IDE, then serve the flow in headless mode in Docker. 
Query the endpoint from a frontend.

## Package the application

1. Build image:
```
docker build -t solvedcaptcha/langflow-pokedex-agent:1.0.0 .
```
2. Run container:
```
docker run -p 7860:7860 solvedcaptcha/langflow-pokedex-agent:1.0.0
```
3. Start frontend application and ask about the Pokemon you're interested in.
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
You **should** get back a full page article and a picture, generated by the Poke API using Langflow.
Right now it just returns the event stream.

## Test other loaded flows

You can drop any flow into the /flows folder and build the Docker image from root.
You don't need the toml and the uv.lock unless you're running locally.

1. Get the flow-id for a flow you loaded (top of the flow file under `id`) and execute a curl against it to confirm it's being served.
2. Add this value to the frontend app.

## Local Development (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the application locally without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Create a Python virtual environment (Python 3.10-3.13 required):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

2. Install the project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
- Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (if it exists)
- Add your required API keys and configurations

4. Start the Langflow server:
```bash
langflow run --env-file .env
```

5. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Langflow server will be available at http://localhost:7860, and the frontend will be at http://localhost:3000.

Note: Running locally requires managing Python dependencies and Node.js packages on your machine. Using Docker is the recommended approach for consistency across environments.
