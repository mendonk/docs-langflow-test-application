# docs-langflow-test-application

An application for testing docs procedures using Langflow.

## Purpose

Create a web application that sends data to Langflow and returns a useful result.

## Package the application

Imitate the filestructure here. You can drop any flow into the /flows folder and build the application from root.

build it:
```
docker build -t solved-captcha/langflow-pokedex-agent:1.0.0 .
```
run it
```
docker run -p 7860:7860 solved-captcha/langflow-pokedex-agent:1.0.0
```
## Test

Get the flow-id for a flow you loaded and execute a curl against it to confirm it's being served.

## Start frontend

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Enter the Pokemon you're interested in the search bar, and you will get back a full page article and a picture, generated by the Poke API using Langflow.

## Local Development (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the application locally without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Create a Python virtual environment (Python 3.10-3.13 required):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

2. Install the project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
- Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (if it exists)
- Add your required API keys and configurations

4. Start the Langflow server:
```bash
langflow run --env-file .env
```

5. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Langflow server will be available at http://localhost:7860, and the frontend will be at http://localhost:3000.

Note: Running locally requires managing Python dependencies and Node.js packages on your machine. Using Docker is the recommended approach for consistency across environments.
